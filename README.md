***Plant Disease Detection***

The scope of the "Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning and Python" project encompasses several key aspects aimed at developing a robust and practical solution for agricultural applications. The project involves the creation and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately identifying various plant diseases from leaf images.

Assembling a comprehensive dataset of leaf images, labeled with corresponding disease categories, and applying data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization. Designing and implementing a CNN architecture using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on optimizing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conducting extensive training sessions, followed by validation against a separate dataset to ensure model robustness and reliability. Comparing the model's performance with traditional image processing methods and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best results.Developing an easy-to-use application for real-time disease detection, potentially integrating with mobile devices for field use by farmers and agricultural professionals

The project aims to provide an efficient, scalable, and accessible tool for enhancing crop monitoring and disease management in agriculture.

***Dataset Description***

Our dataset, sourced from the Kaggle website, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset. This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose. 

Additionally, a separate directory containing 33 test images has been created specifically for prediction purposes. This organization supports robust model development and evaluation, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers and developers aiming to advance plant disease detection technologies. The detailed class categorization and substantial image volume make this dataset a valuable asset for training deep learning models in the field of agricultural technology.
